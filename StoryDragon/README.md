# Welcome to Story Dragon
Story Dragon is an application where the user can write bite-sized pieces of content for a story, character, or location. Users can show their enthusiasm with a like or save the content for their own repurposing later on their profile.

## Technical Stuff
Story Dragon is being written as a CRUD application using Entity Framework in C# and ASP.NET. Currently the plan is to finish the backend as soon as possible and then create the front end using React tooling.

## Some Goals For The Project
This is meant to be a showcase for my skills as a C# Developer. With that in mind, I want to do the following:

- [] Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
- [] Make your application a CRUD API
- [] Create 3 or more unit tests for your application
